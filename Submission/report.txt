1. numInputs * log(BlockSize) FLOPS are performed
2. 2 * numInputs reads are performed
3. There are (numInputs/BlockSize) global writes performed
4. It synchronises at log(blocksize) 
NSIGHT says there are 312,512 global memory read requests, with a sizeof(float) == 8 bytes, this would mean 2,500,096 bytes read. There are 9773 global write requests, meaning there are 71,184 bytes written. 
This is significant as the ratio of bytes read to written is approximately 256:1, which implies that, 256 = [2 * numInputs] /  [numInputs/BlockSize].
